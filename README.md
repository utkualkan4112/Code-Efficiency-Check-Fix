# Code-Efficiency-Check-Fix
Code Efficiency Check/Fix using ChatGPT response

## Overview

This tool harnesses the power of ChatGPT to identify inefficient code segments and provide optimized solutions. By training ChatGPT with numerous examples of inefficient code alongside their efficient counterparts, the tool has the capability to not only detect problematic code but also suggest fixes.

## How it Works

1. **Training Phase**: We feed ChatGPT with a wide array of inefficient code snippets along with their optimized solutions.
2. **Detection & Solution Phase**: When you input a piece of inefficient code, ChatGPT detects the problem and promptly provides a more efficient solution.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the tool interface.
2. Paste your code into the designated input area.
3. Click on "Check Efficiency".
4. Review the feedback provided by ChatGPT and the suggested efficient code.

## Features

- **Automated Detection**: No need to manually pinpoint inefficient sections. The tool does it for you!
- **Optimized Solutions**: Get the most efficient solution tailored to your specific code.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you come across any inefficiencies or have solutions that could be added to the training set, please open a pull request or issue.
